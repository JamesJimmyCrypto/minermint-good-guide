How to:

To code a web app similar to the one at the domain https://btcminingco.com/btc_calculator.html, using HTML and Solidity, based on the codebase from https://github.com/KevinRoozrokh/btc_profit_calculator, you can follow the following step-by-step guide:

1. Set up the development environment:
   - Ensure you have a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write your HTML and Solidity code.
   - Create a new directory or project folder for your web app.

2. Clone the codebase:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/KevinRoozrokh/btc_profit_calculator.git
     ```

3. Open the HTML file:
   - In the cloned project folder, locate the `btc_calculator.html` file and open it in your text editor.

4. Review the existing code:
   - Read through the existing HTML code to understand the structure of the calculator web app.
   - Take note of any specific class names, IDs, or data attributes used in the HTML elements.

5. Create a Solidity file:
   - In the same project folder, create a new Solidity file (e.g., `btc_calculator.sol`) and open it in your text editor.

6. Write Solidity code:
   - Inside the `btc_calculator.sol` file, write your Solidity code to implement the calculator functionality.
   - Define the necessary variables, including the input values for calculations.
   - Implement the calculations and return the results using Solidity functions.

7. Link the Solidity contract:
   - Inside the HTML file, add a `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag.
   - Set the `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag to link to the Solidity contract (e.g., `src="btc_calculator.sol"`).

8. Create a connection to the blockchain:
   - Use web3.js or another Ethereum JavaScript library to create a connection to the blockchain network.
   - Provide the necessary configuration details, such as the provider URL and contract address.

9. Interact with the contract:
   - Use JavaScript code within the HTML file to interact with the deployed Solidity contract.
   - Instantiate the contract using the connection object and the contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface).
   - Call the contract's functions and pass any required parameters to perform calculations and retrieve results.

10. Style the web app:
    - Use CSS to style your web app and make it visually appealing.
    - Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) and link it to the HTML file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.
    - Define CSS rules and styles for your HTML elements to control their appearance.

11. Test and debug:
    - Open the HTML file in a web browser to test the functionality of your web app.
    - Use the browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to inspect elements, check for errors, and debug your JavaScript code if needed.
    - Test different scenarios and inputs to ensure your app works as expected.

12. Deploy the web app:
    - Once you are satisfied with your web app, you can deploy it to a web server or hosting platform.
    - Upload the HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Solidity files to a hosting service of your choice.
    - Ensure that the necessary files are correctly linked and accessible in the deployed environment.
    - Deploy the Solidity contract to the Ethereum network using tools like Remix or Truffle.

13. Continuously maintain and

 update the app:
    - Monitor your web app for any reported issues or bugs.
    - Address and fix any identified problems promptly.
    - Implement new features or improvements based on user feedback or your own objectives.
    - Keep your Solidity contract up to date and consider upgrading it as needed.

Please note that the specific implementation details and functionality of the web app at the provided domain may not be fully covered in this general guide. It is recommended to review the actual codebase or any accompanying documentation for the web app to get a more accurate understanding of its implementation. Additionally, deploying and interacting with Solidity contracts require familiarity with blockchain development and Ethereum ecosystem tools.
