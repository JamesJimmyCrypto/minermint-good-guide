How to:

To code a web app similar to the one at the domain https://btcminingco.com/minermint.html using HTML and Solidity, you can follow the following step-by-step guide:

1. Set up the development environment:
   - Ensure you have a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write your code.
   - Create a new directory or project folder for your web app.

2. Clone the codebase:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/KevinRoozrokh/minermint.git
     ```

3. Open the HTML file:
   - In the cloned project folder, locate the `minermint.html` file and open it in your text editor.

4. Review the existing HTML code:
   - Read through the existing HTML code to understand the structure of the web app.
   - Take note of any specific class names, IDs, or data attributes used in the HTML elements.

5. Create a Solidity file:
   - In the same project folder, create a new Solidity file (e.g., `MinerMint.sol`) and open it in your text editor.

6. Write Solidity code:
   - Inside the `MinerMint.sol` file, write your Solidity code to define the smart contract for the web app.
   - Define the contract name, state variables, functions, and any necessary event declarations.
   - Implement the desired functionality of the smart contract, such as minting new tokens or managing transactions.

7. Compile the Solidity code:
   - Compile the Solidity code using a Solidity compiler, such as the one provided by the Solidity IDE or the Solidity compiler available with Ethereum development tools like Truffle.
   - Ensure that the compiled bytecode and ABI (Application Binary Interface) are generated.

8. Link the Solidity contract:
   - Inside the HTML file, locate the `<script>` tag that references the Solidity contract.
   - Update the `contractAddress` variable with the address of the deployed smart contract on the Ethereum network.

9. Deploy the Solidity contract:
   - Deploy the Solidity smart contract to the Ethereum network using a tool like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
   - Follow the deployment steps provided by the chosen development tool to deploy the contract to a testnet or the mainnet.

10. Test the web app:
    - Open the HTML file in a web browser to test the functionality of your web app.
    - Interact with the web app's UI and verify that it communicates with the deployed smart contract correctly.
    - Test different scenarios and inputs to ensure the app functions as expected.

11. Style the web app:
    - Use CSS to style your web app and make it visually appealing.
    - Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) and link it to the HTML file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.
    - Define CSS rules and styles for your HTML elements to control their appearance.

12. Deploy the web app:
    - Once you are satisfied with your web app and the Solidity contract, you can deploy them to a web server or hosting platform.
    - Upload the HTML, CSS, and any JavaScript files to a hosting service of your choice.
    - Ensure that the necessary files are correctly linked and accessible in the deployed environment.

13. Continuously maintain and update the app:
    - Monitor your web app for any reported issues or bugs.
    - Address and fix any identified problems promptly.
    - Implement new features or improvements based on user feedback or your own objectives.
